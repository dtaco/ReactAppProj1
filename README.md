##Storefront - React-Redux

#Description:    My first React/Redux combo project to create a basic storefront.

#Objective:      To create a dynamic storefront using the Reactjs language while using a combination of React and Redux for state management.

#Current focus:  The basic framework of the storefront is complete, including containers, action types, and reducers. The App has routing and functionality, and the state is seamlessly handled through all actions. API calls are handled through the use of Axios.

#Next focus: Change some styling and create a base home page with a CTA. Look into store cart functionality.
